# tshock-randomize-mobs
 Randomizes enemy mob spawns
 
***

In an attempt to make it balanced / playable:
- Mobs are seperated into 3 categories: pre-hardmode, pre-plantera, and post-plantera
- To make invasions possible to complete, not all invasion enemeies are randomized
- Bosses spawns are not randomized (although some of their minions/spawns are)
- Aditional balancing may be required, please report anything you would like fixed
